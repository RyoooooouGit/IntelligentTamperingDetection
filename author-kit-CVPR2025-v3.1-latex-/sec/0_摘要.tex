    In this experiment, the Faster R-CNN and YOLO models were used as baselines and innovated upon to complete the document tampering detection task. By introducing region threshold filtering, multi-scale data augmentation, and adjusting parameters such as the number of training epochs, batch size, and unified image size, the YOLO11m model was used to achieve the best detection performance, with the highest Micro-F1 score reaching 93.68.
